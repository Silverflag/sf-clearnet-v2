This is a basic website that I am working on at the domain "silverflag.net"

The idea is for a free information respository using a custom backend currently in development to pull and parse data from our growing list of RSS streams from various websites.
Using the data (of course linking to the source) we will provice a solution for users to be able to get news along with our curated news of the sources and have useful recommends supplied to them entirely in their browser
This should make it more private as the reccomends and their reading habits are done locally
Some caviats of this are that they are still retreiving the articles from the server, though it is being set up to not show that information and having the logs be anonymized by the ingress proxy.

For unrelated reasons, the main website is currently down.

Please use the mirror at [silverflag.efenow.xyz](https://silverflag.efenow.xyz) while this is down. Sorry for the inconvinience.
